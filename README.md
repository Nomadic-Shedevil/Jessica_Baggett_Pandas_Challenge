# Jessica_Baggett_Pandas_Challenge

In the PyCitySchools directory, please reference the "Jessica Baggett Analysis" for completion of assignment and grading. The original file of "PyCitySchools_starter" was utilized as a reference for self checking work and progress/referral to what final results in tables should look like. And "Randomtest.py" was utilized as a blank test file during class hours to help walk me through how to push to Github from desktop by my TA and Instructor.
